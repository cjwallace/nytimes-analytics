 Inside the List 

 body:
 Completely Different: “So, Anyway. . . ,” a memoir by the British comedian and actor John Cleese, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 9. Is Cleese the funniest movie star of all time? Last summer, when Time Out London ranked the Top 100 comedies, Cleese and his accomplices in Monty Python had two films among the top five — “Life of Brian” at No. 3 and “The Holy Grail” at No. 5 — while “The Meaning of Life” came in at No. 58. Cleese also appeared in a couple of non-Python movies on the list: “Clockwise” at No. 80 and, with his Python sidekick Michael Palin, “A Fish Called Wanda” at No. 87. (This dominance may explain why the American Film Institute, compiling a similar project in 2000, stayed true to its name and limited the choice to American films.)
In July a letter made the rounds that Cleese once sent to a 14-year-old admirer, responding to the boy’s question about a fan club. “Dear Matthew,” it read, “I am afraid I’m much too important to write notes to people like you. Please remember that I am very very very very very very important. However, there is no John Cleese fan club (despite my importance) because they were all murdered in 1983 by Michael Palins’ fan club. I enclose a photograph to remind you of my importance. Yours sincerely, John Cleese.” (The errant apostrophe was in the original; as one wit promptly tweeted, “I always knew there had to be more than one of Michael Palin.”)
Outside the Box: It’s tempting, when you read that Jennifer Lopez has written a book called “True Love” (new at No. 5 on the hardcover nonfiction list), to start digging up old Bennifer and “Gigli” jokes from late-night TV circa 2003. But darn it, Lopez is so strong and sincere and resilient — her title refers, sensibly enough, to the importance of loving yourself first — that she manages to neutralize any ungenerous comments in advance. On the “Today” show recently, Lopez told Maria Shriver that she’d made her risqué “Booty” video for feminist reasons: “This is great for women to see,” she said. “I feel like at a certain age they try to put women to sleep. . . . It makes me crazy that people try to put women in a box or try to say if you’re a mom, you can’t do this. I can be an awesome mom and I can be a sexy woman and I can be a smart business person. I can do all of it. Just let me. Mama still got it.”
Big in Sweden: Richard Ford’s 2012 novel “Canada” has caught on in Sweden. “For reasons no one understands,” he told The Australian last month, “it has become a kind of ‘everybody reads it on the train’ best seller, and now it’s out in paperback and it’s No. 2 on the best-seller list. Nothing like this ever has happened to me in the United States. It’s like a Woody Allen movie.” Ford may have been playing down his stature in America: “Let Me Be Frank With You,” the latest entry in his Frank Bascombe chronicles, enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 14.
